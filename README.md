# Forced Harmonic Motion Analysis

## Description
This project explores the resonance behavior in a forced harmonic motion system, focusing on a mass-spring setup. Using precision tools like oscilloscopes and function generators, I conducted experiments to measure key parameters, including amplitude, resonance frequency, and damping time. Through data analysis software, I tracked and evaluated system behavior across various frequencies to understand resonance dynamics.

## Objectives
- Measure amplitude, resonance frequency, and damping time.
- Use oscilloscopes and function generators for precise data collection.
- Analyze data to observe resonance patterns in forced harmonic motion.

## Key Learnings
- Developed hands-on lab skills with advanced equipment.
- Gained insights into forced harmonic motion and resonance.
- Applied data analysis techniques essential for engineering and physics research.
